Tripoli
=======

This is the documentation for *Tripoli*, a Python-Emacs interface. With it, you
can configure Emacs with Python instead of Emacs lisp.

Reasons why you might want to do such a thing include:

- you simply like Python,
- you donâ€™t like Python but you positively loathe Emacs lisp,
- your existing Emacs configuration is a bit too fast for your taste, or
- you want to see if you can.

.. warning::
   Tripoli is in flux and highly experimental software.
