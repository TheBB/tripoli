=====================
The Design of Tripoli
=====================

Tripoli is organized in three layers, each increasingly Pythonic and less Emacsy.

1. When imported, the library launches an embedded Python interpreter and
   imports a module called :code:`emacs_raw`, which provides a relatively
   minimalistic interface to Emacs. It is designed to provide the bare minimum
   of machinery necessary to build upon in Python. See :doc:`raw`.
2. When the :code:`tripoli` module is imported, a “fake” module named
   :code:`emacs` is available. This module and its submodules are dynamically
   generated when imported, and provide a reasonably intuitive interface to the
   Emacs namespace, making it appear to be modular when in fact it is not. See
   :doc:`namespace`.
3. The third layer is not yet done.

The design of each of these layers is expanded on in the following.
