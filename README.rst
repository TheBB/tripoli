Tripoli
=======

Tripoli is a Python-Emacs interface. With it, you can configure Emacs with
Python instead of Emacs lisp.

Reasons why you might want to do such a thing include:

- you simply like Python.
- you donâ€™t like Python but you positively loathe Emacs lisp.
- your existing Emacs configuration is a bit too fast for your taste.
- you want to see if you can.

At the moment, the focus has been on accessing Emacs lisp from Python, not the
other way around.

You can read the latest documentation `here <https://thebb.github.io/tripoli/>`_.
